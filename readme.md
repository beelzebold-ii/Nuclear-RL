\# Nuclear Roguelike

Nuclear Inc. is a multi-trillion dollar "clean" nuclear energy company spanning across all of North America.



In a failed case of corporate espionage between rival companies, all that was uncovered were implications of tax fraud, and mass dumping of waste wherever they pleased.



Of course, a police investigation soon followed, revealing much more terrifying experiments being conducted... that is, until somebody somewhere was paid off.



The lead detective was silenced, the outsourced freelancer framed for murder, and the investigation shut down.





Nobody can save the continent from near certain destruction.

Nuclear RL is a retro themed modern setting traditional roguelike, with guns and stuff.



Eh, let's try that again.



Nuclear RL is a retro themed modern setting traditional roguelike, with various types of guns, playstyles, annoying as shit enemies, and unique combat mechanics.



You play as either a cop let go after the shutdown of the investigation, the former detective who's slipped out of their ankle monitor, the contractor hired by the desperate detective (then subsequently made into the target of a manhunt), or a war veteran injured by Nuclear's carelessness. Each class has unique starting equipment and modifiers to their stats.



Controls are as follows: F to select a target and again to fire at it, R to reload, M to see more about a targetted enemy, arrows to move, G to pick up an item, I to open the inventory, and E to open the equipment and stats screen.



Arrows and enter navigate menus, backspace drops an item or some ammo from the inventory screen. Enter also descends stairs (which display as a right angle bracket, >)



The player is a blue @, enemies are various colored letters, ammo is an aterisk, \*, armor is a square bracket, \[, and weapons are curly brackets, }. Walls are hash marks, #, green equal signs, =, are acid (which \*will\* kill you), percent signs (%) are corpses, and a simple period, . , is a floor tile.
